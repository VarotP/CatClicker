# Unnamed Idle Game
## Fun while not doing too much


- ### What will the application do?
  - This application will be an **idle game**, a genre of a game where the user clicks or makes a decision once in a while and lets the game _play itself_.
- ### Who will use it?
  - This game will rated **E for everyone**, even your grandfather will be able to play this one.
- ### Why is this project of interest to you?
  - I've always had an interest in game design, and due to the nature of the simplicity of the genre of this game, the challenge here is to actually make it fun. Some examples of past games in this genre that have done it well are Cookie Clicker, AdVenture Capitalist, AFK Arena, etc.
